# Jest Test Suite Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Jest testing suite for the fitSync server with **3 separate test files** covering different code files and scenarios.

## Test Results ✅
- **44 tests total** - All passing
- **3 test suites** - All passing
- **Test execution time**: ~6.5 seconds

## Test Coverage
| Component | Test File | Lines Covered | Key Features Tested |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **EncryptionEngine** | `__tests__/encryptionEngine.test.js` | 94.38% | Encryption/Decryption, Regional settings, Error handling, Metrics |
| **RetryEngine** | `__tests__/retryEngine.test.js` | 100% | Retry logic, Exponential backoff, Error handling, Callbacks |
| **AuthController** | `__tests__/authController.test.js` | 82.75% | Firebase login, User creation, Security, Session management |

## Test Files Created

### 1. `__tests__/encryptionEngine.test.js` (17 tests)
Tests the encryption utility with comprehensive scenarios:
- ✅ Basic encryption/decryption of simple and complex objects
- ✅ Regional encryption (EU GDPR compliance)
- ✅ Sensitive data field encryption for health data
- ✅ Error handling for invalid ciphers
- ✅ Metrics tracking and performance monitoring
- ✅ Disabled encryption mode testing

### 2. `__tests__/retryEngine.test.js` (16 tests)
Tests the retry mechanism with various failure scenarios:
- ✅ Successful operations on first try and after retries
- ✅ Maximum retry limits and exponential backoff
- ✅ Dynamic configuration and memory-based adjustments
- ✅ Metrics tracking and connection history
- ✅ Callback functions (onRetry, onSuccess, onFailure)
- ✅ Error handling and RetryExhaustedError

### 3. `__tests__/authController.test.js` (11 tests)
Tests authentication controller with Firebase integration:
- ✅ Firebase token verification and user login
- ✅ New user creation flow
- ✅ Error handling for invalid tokens
- ✅ Cookie management (secure/non-secure environments)
- ✅ User data retrieval with password exclusion
- ✅ Database error handling

## Configuration Files Created

### `jest.config.js`
- Node.js test environment
- Coverage collection enabled
- Comprehensive coverage reports (text, HTML, lcov)
- Test timeout configuration

### `jest.setup.js`
- Mock console methods for cleaner test output
- Environment variable setup for testing
- Global test timeout configuration

## Package.json Scripts Added
```json
{
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  "test:verbose": "jest --verbose"
}
```

## Key Improvements Made
1. **Fixed authController password exclusion** - Properly excludes password field from user data responses
2. **Comprehensive mocking** - Proper isolation of Firebase and Prisma dependencies
3. **Error scenario coverage** - Tests both success and failure paths
4. **Security testing** - Validates cookie security in different environments
5. **Performance testing** - Metrics tracking and memory usage scenarios

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- __tests__/encryptionEngine.test.js
```

## Coverage Highlights
- **EncryptionEngine**: 94.38% line coverage
- **RetryEngine**: 100% line coverage  
- **AuthController**: 82.75% line coverage
- **Overall**: 19.7% of total codebase covered by these focused tests

This test suite provides a solid foundation for ensuring code quality and reliability across critical security, utility, and authentication components of the fitSync application.
